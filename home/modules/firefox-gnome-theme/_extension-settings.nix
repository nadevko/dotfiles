    Adaptive Tab Bar Colour support

      **Note**: Adaptive Tab Bar Colour presently hard-codes the colours for the home page (both normal as well as private windows). When navigating from the home page to any other page, the colour of the UI might momentarily switch to the original firefox home page colour before switching back to the expected colour (this is especially noticeable in private windows). This only happens when navigating from the homepage to another page, subsequent navigations should be unaffected.
